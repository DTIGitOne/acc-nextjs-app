This is a Next.JS fullstack project i am working on. 

It will be an app for me to display car data of a racing simulator i play. The user will be able to play the lap uploaded and be able to see the live telemetry of the car.
The lap will be an mp4 video and the data will be read from the csv tememetry file that is matched to the video.

In this case i am first developing most of the frontend first before starting to create the server side logic for storing the mp4 files and .csv files.
